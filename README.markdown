# deviantArt iOS OAuth 2.0 Example
A basic example of how to use OAuth 2.0 and the [deviantArt stash API](http://www.deviantart.com/developers/oauth2) to post an image from the iPhone. It hasn't been tested in iOS < 4.2

## Trying it out
[Creating an application on the dA website](http://www.deviantart.com/submit/app/) and then put your `client_id` and `client_secret` at the top of `DeviantArt.m`

## Uses these wonderful libraries (Thanks!)
* [OAuth2Client](https://github.com/nxtbgthng/OAuth2Client/)
* [JSONKit](https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit)
